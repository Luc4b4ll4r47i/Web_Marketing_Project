# Web Marketing Project

This repository contains the exam project of the "Web Marketing" course at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

The purpose of this project is to analyse the available data with descriptive statistics and visualizations, and then exploit the results to define profitable data-driven strategies.
RFM model, Churn Propensity model and Market Basket Analysis were developed to address the problem of retaining high-value customers as core requirements.
Data were provided by the University and are about a business oriented on the retail aspect, in which there are both an interaction linked to various physical stores and an interaction with digital channels.

The project was carried out together with the colleague Francesco Oliviero.
